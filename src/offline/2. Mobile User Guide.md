## 📶 Do I Need Internet?

### Mobile (M3U):
- **First play**: Needs internet to stream/download
- **After**: Depends on your app (many cache/download automatically)
- **VLC**: Offers to download for offline use

### Desktop (ZIP):
- **Download once**, play forever offline
- Completely self-contained

## 🎧 Sound Quality

All FLAC files are **automatically converted** to:
- **MP3 320kbps** (very high quality)
- Indistinguishable from original for most people
- ~70% smaller file sizes
- Works on ALL devices

Original MP3/M4A/AAC files are kept as-is.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "I can't open the M3U file"
**iPhone**: Must use Safari browser (not Chrome)  
**Android**: Install VLC first, then try again

### "It says 'file not supported'"
You need a music player app:
- iPhone: VLC or Apple Music
- Android: VLC, Poweramp, or any music player

### "Nothing happens when I tap download"
Try:
1. Long-press the download link
2. Choose "Download linked file"
3. Then open from Downloads folder

### "Can I use Spotify?"
Not directly - Spotify doesn't support M3U imports for custom music. Use VLC instead (it's free!).

### "The files are huge!"
Use the Mobile option instead of Desktop ZIP. The mobile option streams on-demand, so you're not downloading everything at once.
