# Mixtape editor

The file `routes/editor.py` acts as the backend interface for the mixtape editor UI, managing the lifecycle of mixtape creation and editing, integrating with the music library, and handling file storage for mixtape data and cover images. It ensures that only authenticated users can access editor functionality. Its primary responsibility is to provide endpoints for creating, editing, searching, and saving mixtapes, including handling cover images and metadata. The file uses authentication, interacts with a music collection, and manages mixtape data as JSON files on disk.

## High‑Level Overview

The Mixtape Editor is a full‑featured UI that lets a logged‑in user:

* **Search** the music library (powered by `MusicCollectionUI.search_highlighting`).
* **Add** individual tracks or whole albums to a playlist (the mixtape).
* **Re‑order** tracks via drag‑and‑drop (Sortable.js).
* **Edit** the mixtape title, liner notes (EasyMDE markdown editor), and cover art (upload or auto‑generated composite).
* **Save** a new mixtape or **update** an existing one (via `MixtapeManager`).
* **Monitor** background audio‑caching progress through a Server‑Sent Events (SSE) stream and a Bootstrap‑styled **progress modal**.

All of this lives under the Flask blueprint editor (`/editor/*`) and is protected by the `@require_auth` decorator.

## Flask Blueprint & Routes


| HTTP Method | URL Pattern                        | Handler                   | Key Behaviour |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| GET         | `/editor/`                         | `new_mixtape()`           | Renders a blank editor (`preload_mixtape` contains empty fields). |
| GET         | `/editor/<slug>`                   | `edit_mixtape(slug)`      | Loads mixtape JSON via `MixtapeManager.get(slug)` and renders the editor pre-filled. |
| GET         | `/editor/search?q=`                | `search()`                | Returns up to 50 highlighted results (artist/album/track) as JSON. Minimum query length = 3. |
| GET         | `/editor/artist_details?artist=`   | `artist_details()`        | Returns JSON `{artist, albums:[{album, cover, tracks,…}], …}`. 400 if missing. |
| GET         | `/editor/album_details?release_dir=` | `album_details()`        | Returns JSON `{artist, album, tracks:[…], cover, is_compilation}`. 400 if missing. |
| POST        | `/editor/save`                     | `save_mixtape()`          | Accepts a JSON payload (title, cover, liner_notes, tracks, optional slug). Handles create (new UUID) and update (existing slug). Returns `{success:true, slug, url,…}`. |
| GET         | `/editor/progress/<slug>`          | `progress_stream(slug)`   | Server-Sent Events (SSE) that emit `{type:"connected"}` then `{step, status, message, current, total}` objects. Used by ProgressModal. |
| POST        | `/editor/generate_composite`       | `generate_composite()`    | Takes `{covers: [url,…]}` → returns `{data_url: "data:image/png;base64,…"}` (composite cover). 400/500 on error. |

All routes are protected by `@require_auth`, so unauthenticated users are redirected to the login flow.

## Data Flow & Server‑Side Logic

1. Creating a New Mixtape
    * `new_mixtape()` builds an empty dict (`title`, `cover`, `liner_notes`, `tracks`, `slug`, `timestamps`) and renders `editor.html` with preload_mixtape set to that dict.
    * The client receives a `client‑id` (generated lazily via `crypto.randomUUID()` and stored in `localStorage["current_mixtape_client_id"])` to guarantee idempotent creates.
2. Editing an Existing Mixtape
    * `edit_mixtape(slug)` instantiates a `MixtapeManager` (pointing at `app.config["MIXTAPE_DIR"]`) and calls `get(slug)`.
    * The resulting dict (including cover, liner_notes, tracks, timestamps) is passed to the template as preload_mixtape.
    * The hidden <input id="editing-slug"> carries the slug so the client knows it is an **update**.
3. Saving (`save_mixtape`)
    * Payload is parsed from JSON.
    * **Track enrichment** – each track’s cover is refreshed via `collection.get_cover(release_dir)`.
    * If a `slug` is present → **update** (`MixtapeManager.update`). Otherwise → **create** (`MixtapeManager.save`).
    * After a successful write, a **background audio‑caching job** is launched (if `AUDIO_CACHE_PRECACHE_ON_UPLOAD` is true) via a daemon thread that calls `_trigger_audio_caching_async`.
    * The response includes the final slug and a URL (`/editor/<slug>`).
4. Progress Streaming (`progress_stream`)
    * Uses `audio_cache.get_progress_tracker` to obtain a `ProgressTracker`.
    * The generator yields SSE lines (`data: {...}\n\n`).
    * The client consumes these events in `progressModal.js`.
5. Composite Cover Generation (`generate_composite`)
    * Receives an array of cover URLs, builds a grid composite (via `CoverCompositor.generate_grid_composite`) and returns a data‑URL (`image/png;base64,…`).

## Client‑Side Architecture

All editor‑related scripts live under `static/js/editor/`.
They are **module‑scoped** (ES6 `import`/`export`) and loaded by `index.js` after the DOM is ready.

| Module | Exported Symbol(s) | Core Responsibility |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| `index.js` | – | Bootstraps the whole page: preload mixtape data, initialise EasyMDE, search, playlist, UI, and set the initial “Liner-Notes” sub-tab. |
| `search.js` | `initSearch` | Debounced search input → `/editor/search` → render grouped results (artists, albums, tracks). Handles lazy loading of album/artist details, “Add” buttons, and preview play/pause. |
| `playlist.js` | `playlist, initPlaylist, addToPlaylist, setPlaylist, register*Callback` | Manages the playlist array, renders the sortable list, handles track-play preview, removal, and “Add whole album” actions. Emits callbacks for unsaved-changes and toast notifications. |
| `editorNotes.js` | `initEditorNotes` | Instantiates EasyMDE, wires up the preview pane, and registers a custom `previewRender` that expands #1, #2-4 references using the current playlist. |
| `ui.js` | `initUI, activateInitialNotesTab` | Handles cover upload/composite modal, Save button (including client-id handling), floating-button behaviour, unsaved-changes detection, navigation guard, and the bottom audio player. |
| `progressModal.js` | `showProgressModal` | Constructs a Bootstrap modal that displays a progress bar, log of caching events, and a “Close” button that appears only after completion. Connects to the SSE endpoint. |
| `utils.js` | `escapeHtml, escapeRegExp, highlightText, showAlert, showConfirm, renderTrackReferences, htmlSafeJson` | Miscellaneous helpers used across the UI (HTML escaping, markdown rendering, modal dialogs). |
| `coverCompositor.js` (via `utils.CoverCompositor`) | – | Generates a composite cover image from a set of track covers (used by `/editor/generate_composite`). |

All modules share a single source of truth (`playlist` array) and communicate via **callback registration** (unsaved‑changes, toast notifications). No circular imports occur.

## UI Layout (Jinja Template – `editor.html`)

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Header (`<h1>`) | Dynamically shows “Create Mixtape”, “Edit Mixtape”, or “Edit: <title>”. |
| Search Bar | Large pill-shaped input with a search icon, info-popover (advanced search tips), and a loading spinner. |
| Results Column (`col-lg-7`) | Card titled Library – initially shows a placeholder; populated by `search.js` with artists, albums, and tracks. |
| Mixtape Column (`col-lg-5`) | Card titled My Mixtape – contains cover image + upload button, title textarea, tabs (Tracks / Liner Notes), playlist `<ol>` (rendered by `playlist.js`), and a Clear button. |
| Floating Buttons (mobile only) | “Save” (hidden until unsaved) and “Tracks” (always visible) – positioned bottom-right. |
| Bottom Audio Player (`#audio-player-container`) | Fixed-bottom panel that shows the currently playing preview track (cover, title, artist) and a native `<audio>` element. |
| Modals | Generic `appModal` (alerts/confirmations), Cover Options modal (Upload vs Composite). |
| Toasts | “Track added”, “Track removed”, and “Public link copied” toasts (Bootstrap). |
| Progress Modal (injected by `progressModal.js`) | Not in the template; created dynamically when saving. |

All elements use **Bootstrap 5** utilities and custom CSS variables (`--color‑track`, `--bs-body-bg`, etc.) for light/dark and semantic Theming.

## JavaScript Modules & Their Responsibilities

### Page Load (`index.js`)

```js
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
    // 1️⃣ Pre‑populate playlist, cover, title (if editing)
    // 2️⃣ Initialise EasyMDE (with pre‑loaded liner notes)
    // 3️⃣ Initialise search, playlist UI, and UI glue code
    // 4️⃣ Activate the correct Liner‑Notes sub‑tab (Write vs Preview)
});
```

* **Pre‑load data** – `window.PRELOADED_MIXTAPE` (populated by Flask) is read.
* **Playlist** – `setPlaylist(preloadMixtape.tracks)` populates the UI list.
* **Cover & Title** – If a cover URL exists, it is set on `#playlist-cover`; title is placed in the textarea (`#playlist-title`).
* **Unsaved‑Changes Reset** – When editing an existing mixtape (`slug` present) the stored `client_id` is kept; for a brand‑new mixtape the local‑storage `current_mixtape_client_id` is cleared.
* **Editor (EasyMDE)** – `initEditorNotes(preloadMixtape.liner_notes)` creates the markdown editor with the appropriate initial value.
* **UI Init** – `initSearch()`, `initPlaylist()`, `initUI()` wire up all interactive pieces (search bar, playlist drag‑&‑drop, floating buttons, unsaved‑change detection, etc.).
* **Liner‑Notes Tab** – `activateInitialNotesTab(hasNotes)` selects Preview if there are saved notes, otherwise Write.

### Library Search (`search.js`)

* **Debounced input** – 300 ms after the user stops typing, a request to `/editor/search?q=` is sent.
* **Results Rendering** – Returned JSON is grouped by `type` (`artist`, `album`, `track`).
* **Artists** → collapsible accordion (`bg-artist`). Clicking expands to lazily load the artist’s albums via `/editor/artist_details`.
* **Albums** → collapsible accordion (`bg-album`). Expanding loads tracks via `/editor/album_details`.
* **Tracks** → list items with a **preview** button (plays a short preview via the global audio player) and an **add** button (pushes the track into the playlist).
* **Add‑Album** – Inside an album accordion a “Add whole album” button adds *all* tracks at once.
* **Highlighting** – Search terms are wrapped in `<mark>` by the back‑end (`MusicCollection.search_highlighting`). The UI adds extra colour classes for visual distinction.

### Playlist (`playlist.js`)

* **Data model** – `window.playlist` is a plain array of objects `{artist, album, track, duration, path, filename, cover}`.
* **Rendering** – `renderPlaylist()` builds an ordered list (`<ol id="playlist">`) with:
  * Drag handle (`.drag-handle`) for reordering.
  * Cover thumbnail (or placeholder).
  * Play‑preview overlay button (`.play-overlay-btn`).
  * Track title, artist · album, duration, and a delete button.
* **Drag‑&‑Drop** – Powered by **Sortable.js**; after a reorder the array is rebuilt from the DOM order.
* **Play‑preview** – Clicking a track’s overlay button:
  1. Loads the file into the **global audio player** (`#global-audio-player`).
  2. Shows the bottom player container (`#audio-player-container`).
  3. Updates “Now playing” title/artist and cover image.
  4. Toggles the button icon between **play** (`bi-play-fill`) and **pause** (`bi-pause-fill`).
* **Add / Remove callbacks** – `registerTrackAddedCallback` and `registerTrackRemovedCallback` fire toast notifications (`#addTrackToast`, `#removeTrackToast`).

### Liner‑Notes (`editorNotes.js`)

* **EasyMDE** – Configured with a custom toolbar, spell‑checker disabled, and a **preview renderer** that expands `#1`, `#2‑4`, etc. using the current playlist (`renderTrackReferences`).
* **Live preview** – When the **Preview** tab becomes visible, the markdown is rendered with **marked** → **DOMPurify** → inserted into `#markdown-preview`.
* **Two‑way sync** – Switching back to **Write** retains the editor’s current value; changes in the editor automatically update the preview when the tab is active.

### Save Workflow (`ui.js`)

1. **Mark unsaved** – Any mutation (cover upload, title edit, playlist change, liner‑notes edit) calls `markUnsaved()`.
2. **Badge & floating button** – An “Unsaved” badge appears on the top‑right **Save** button; a floating **Save** button (`#floating-save`) appears on mobile.
3. **Client‑ID handling** –
   * For a new mixtape a UUID (`crypto.randomUUID()`) is stored in `localStorage.current_mixtape_client_id`.
   * The same ID is reused for subsequent saves, guaranteeing **idempotent** creation.
4. **POST `/editor/save`** – Payload includes:
   * `title`, `cover` (data‑URL or `null`), `liner_notes`, `tracks` (plain objects), optional `slug`, and `client_id`.
5. **Server response** – Returns `{success:true, slug, url,…}`.
6. **Open progress modal** – `showProgressModal(slug)` displays the **Progress Modal**.

### Cover Generation / Upload (`ui.js` + `/editor/generate_composite`)

* **Cover Options Modal** – Clicking the camera button opens `#coverOptionsModal` with two choices:
  1. **Upload Image** – Triggers the hidden file input (`#cover-upload`). Validation checks file type (`jpg/png/gif/webp`) and size (≤ 5 MiB). On success the image is read as a data‑URL and displayed.
  2. **Generate Composite** – Sends the list of track cover URLs (`playlist.map(t=>t.cover)`) to `/editor/generate_composite`. The server returns a **data‑URL** PNG which replaces the current cover.
* **Both actions** set `coverDataUrl` and call `markUnsaved()`.

### Navigation Guard & Browser Warning

* **Link interception** – Any internal `<a>` click while `hasUnsavedChanges` is `true` shows a **confirmation modal** (`showConfirm`). If the user confirms, navigation proceeds; otherwise it is cancelled.
* **`beforeunload`** – Browsers display a native “You have unsaved changes…” dialog when the user tries to close, refresh, or navigate away.

### Reorder Mode

* **Toggle button** – `#toggle-reorder-mode` adds/removes the class `reorder-mode` on `<body>`.
* **Effects** –
  * Hides the library column (`.col-lg-7`).
  * Expands the mixtape column to full width.
  * Enlarges the playlist area for easier drag‑&‑drop.
  * Hides the cover/title section to maximize vertical space.

### Floating Buttons (Mobile)

* **Save** – `#floating-save` mirrors the top‑right **Save** button; it becomes visible when there are unsaved changes.
* **Tracks** – `#floating-tracks` jumps to the **Tracks** tab and scrolls the mixtape card into view.

---

**Summary** – The editor page is a tightly‑coupled SPA‑style UI built on vanilla JavaScript, Bootstrap, and a handful of third‑party libraries (Sortable.js, EasyMDE, marked, DOMPurify). All user actions funnel through the central `playlist` model, which synchronises the visual list, the global audio player, and the back‑end save endpoint. Unsaved‑change detection, background audio‑caching progress, and cover‑generation utilities provide a polished, production‑ready experience.

## Interaction Flow (Typical User Journey)

1. **Open** the editor (`/editor/` or `/editor/<slug>`).
2. **Page loads** → `index.js` pre‑populates playlist, cover, title, and liner notes (if editing).
3. **Search** → type ≥ 3 characters → `search.js` fetches results → user clicks Add → track appears in the playlist (toast shown).
4. **Reorder** (optional) → click the expand button → drag handles appear → rearrange tracks.
5. **Edit title / liner notes** → any change marks the mixtape as unsaved (badge appears, floating save button fades in).
6. **Cover** → click camera button → choose Upload or Generate Composite → cover preview updates → unsaved flag set.
7. **Preview a track** → click the play overlay → bottom player appears, showing cover, title, artist; button toggles play/pause.
8. **Save** → click Save (or floating save).
    * Client‑id generated (if new).
    * POST `/editor/save`.
    * Server writes JSON, possibly triggers background audio‑caching.
    * UI shows Progress Modal (`showProgressModal(slug)`).
9. **Progress Modal** receives SSE events → updates progress bar & log.
    * When `completed` → “Close” button enabled → user

## Core Helper Functions (Back‑End)

| Function | File | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| `new_mixtape()` | `editor.py` | Returns a fresh empty mixtape JSON for the template. |
| `edit_mixtape(slug)` | `editor.py` | Retrieves a mixtape via `MixtapeManager.get(slug)` and renders the editor with pre-loaded data. |
| `search()` | `editor.py` | Calls `collection.search_highlighting(query, limit=50)` (the same high-level search used elsewhere). |
| `artist_details()` | `editor.py` | Wrapper around `MusicCollection.get_artist_details(artist)`. |
| `album_details()` | `editor.py` | Wrapper around `MusicCollection.get_album_details(release_dir)`. |
| `save_mixtape()` | `editor.py` | Normalises incoming JSON, enriches each track with its cover (`collection.get_cover(release_dir)`), then either `MixtapeManager.update(slug, …)` or `MixtapeManager.save(...)`. |
| `_trigger_audio_caching_async()` | `editor.py` | Fires a background thread that calls `schedule_mixtape_caching` (from `audio_cache`) and emits progress events via `ProgressTracker`. |
| `generate_composite()` | `editor.py` | Calls `CoverCompositor.generate_grid_composite(covers)` and returns a data-URL. |
| `progress_stream(slug)` | `editor.py` | Returns an SSE Response that streams events from the shared `ProgressTracker`. |

**Important behaviours**

* **Cover handling** – If the client sends a `data:image/...` URL, the server decodes, resizes (max 1200 px width) and stores it as `covers/<slug>.jpg`.
* **Timestamp handling** – `MixtapeManager` adds `created_at` and `updated_at` ISO‑8601 timestamps on creation; `updated_at` is refreshed on each edit.
* **Client‑ID reuse** – `save_mixtape` preserves the original `client_id` when updating, ensuring idempotent uploads.
