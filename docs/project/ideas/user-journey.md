# User Journey

## What Mixtape Society really offering 🎁

You’re not sharing *music files*.
You’re sharing:

* **Taste** (“I thought of you when I heard this”)
* **Curation** (finite, intentional, ordered)
* **A moment** (time + place + mood)
* **A physical gesture** (handing something over)

That’s why the QR card idea is already strong. Let’s build on it.

---

## 1. QR card — but make it meaningful (not just a link)

### What works well

* Familiar
* Cheap
* Easy to scan
* Bridges physical → digital smoothly

### How to elevate it

Instead of “QR → playlist”, make it:

**QR → mixtape landing page**

* Title of the mixtape
* Short personal note (“For late-night train rides”)
* Tracklist with *your annotations*
* Optional cover art
* Optional “play order matters” message

This makes it feel like a *liner note*, not a playlist.

💡 *Key insight:*
The value is not the QR — it’s the **context you wrap around it**.

---

## 2. Cassette / MiniDisc / CD-style card (nostalgia wins hard)

If your audience is even slightly nostalgic:

### Physical object ideas

* **Cassette-shaped card** (with QR on the label)
* **Mini CD sleeve** with artwork and liner notes
* **Folded insert** like old CD booklets
* **Polaroid-sized card** with handwritten vibe

You’re borrowing the *language of old mixtapes* without the technical burden.

Why this works:

* People don’t throw it away
* It invites curiosity
* It signals “this is not disposable content”

---

## 3. NFC instead of (or alongside) QR 📱

If you want a bit of magic:

* NFC sticker embedded in:

  * a card
  * a coin
  * a guitar pick
  * a postcard

**Tap → mixtape opens**

Pros:

* No camera needed
* Feels magical
* Invisible tech (very “modern artifact”)

Cons:

* Slightly more expensive
* Some people don’t know what NFC is (yet)

💡 Hybrid idea: **QR + NFC**, so it always works.

---

## 4. The “artifact” concept (beyond cards)

If you want to go more artistic / memorable:

### Objects with embedded access

* Matchbox with QR inside
* Bookmark
* Sticker set (each sticker = a track)
* Small zine (with QR at the end)
* Postcard mailed instead of handed over

Now the mixtape becomes:

> “A thing that exists in the world”

This fits beautifully with your desire to escape pure digital sharing.

---

## 5. Time-based or ritual-based access ⏳

This is where your app can do something *streaming platforms can’t*:

* Unlock 1 track per day
* Unlock only at night
* “Play in order, no shuffle”
* Expiring mixtape (30 days, then gone)
* “You can only listen once” mode

This mirrors the old limitations of tapes — and limitations create meaning.

---

## 6. Playback without accounts or ads (important constraint)

Since you explicitly want to avoid Spotify/YouTube/etc:

### Practical approaches

* Host audio files yourself (legally important!)
* Use:

  * Independent artists
  * Creative Commons music
  * Your own recordings
  * Bandcamp embeds (artist-friendly, often no ads)
* Progressive Web App:

  * Cache tracks
  * Offline listening after first open

You’re closer to a **digital liner-note player** than a “streaming app”.

---

## 7. A strong framing sentence (this matters)

You might want to articulate your app like this:

> “This is not a playlist.
> It’s a mixtape you give to someone.”

That framing will guide *every design choice*.

---

## My top 3 suggestions for you

If I had to pick:

1. **Beautiful physical card (cassette/CD-inspired)**

   * QR + optional NFC
   * Personal note
2. **Mixtape landing page, not a generic player**

   * Story, mood, annotations
3. **Intentional constraints**

   * Order matters
   * No shuffle
   * Finite

Those three together already differentiate you strongly.

---

If you want, next we can:

* Design the **mixtape landing page UX**
* Define **mixtape metadata** (mood, story, dedication)
* Explore **legal-safe music sources**
* Or help you phrase this as a killer product pitch

Just tell me which direction you want to go 🎶
