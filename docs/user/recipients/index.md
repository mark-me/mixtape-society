## 💭 Want to Create Your Own?

You can't create mixtapes as a recipient—you'd need your own Mixtape Society server.

**Options:**

- Ask your friend if they can give you access to their server
- Set up your own server (requires a music library and Docker)
- Check if there's a shared server you can join
