How Sharing Works

1. **Save Your Mixtape**

    In the editor, click **Save** (or **Ctrl** + **Enter**). The app instantly generates a unique, permanent public link.

2. **Share it**

    After saving, a shareable URL or QR code appears (e.g., https://yourdomain.com/share/my-favorite-songs_20251217_abcd1234). You can copy the link or QR code or download the QR code with cover image and title.

3. **Send It Anywhere**

    Share via email, text, social media, or messaging apps—no app download or account required for recipients.

4. **What Recipients See**

    Anyone with the link opens a beautiful, standalone player: full tracklist, cover art, play/pause, seeking, and next/previous controls. It works perfectly on desktop, phone, or tablet.


## ✨ Key Features

- **No login required** — Recipients stream directly in their browser.
- **Permanent links** — They never expire (unless you delete the mixtape).
- **Privacy control** — Links are unguessable; only people you share with can access.
- **Mobile-friendly** — Responsive design for easy listening on the go.
- **QR codes** — for quick scanning .

!!! tip "Pro Tip"
    Pair your link with a personal message: "Made this mixtape thinking of you—hope it brings back good memories! 🎧"

Sharing is the heart of Mixtape Society. Go make someone's day with your perfect playlist! 🚀
