## How Sharing Works

1. **Save Your Mixtape**

    In the editor, click **Save** (or **Ctrl** + **Enter**). The app instantly generates a unique, permanent public link.

2. **Share it**

    After saving, a shareable URL or QR code appears (e.g., <https://yourdomain.com/share/my-favorite-songs_20251217_abcd1234>). You can copy the link or QR code or download the QR code with cover image and title.

3. **Send It Anywhere**

    Share via email, text, social media, or messaging apps—no app download or account required for recipients.

4. **What Recipients See**

    Anyone with the link opens a beautiful, standalone player: full tracklist, cover art, play/pause, seeking, and next/previous controls. It works perfectly on desktop, phone, or tablet.
